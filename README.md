# 🌤️ Weather App - Real-Time Weather Information

A modern, responsive weather application that provides real-time weather data, 5-day forecasts, and air quality information for any location worldwide. Built with vanilla JavaScript and powered by the OpenWeatherMap API.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This weather application delivers comprehensive meteorological data in a clean, user-friendly interface. Users can search for any city globally or use automatic location detection to get instant weather updates, including current conditions, extended forecasts, and air quality metrics.

## ✨ Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric conditions
- **5-Day Weather Forecast**: Extended predictions with daily high/low temperatures and average conditions
- **Air Quality Index (AQI)**: Color-coded air quality monitoring with 5 levels (Good to Very Poor)
- **Auto-Location Detection**: GPS-based automatic weather retrieval for user's current location
- **City Search**: Global city database with instant weather lookup

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern UI/UX**: Gradient backgrounds, smooth animations, and intuitive interface
- **Visual Weather Icons**: Dynamic weather condition icons from OpenWeatherMap
- **Sunrise/Sunset Times**: Local time display for sun events
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback during data fetching

### Technical Features
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, pure ES6+ implementation
- **Fetch API**: Asynchronous data retrieval
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Modern layout techniques
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error management and user feedback
- **API Integration**: OpenWeatherMap Current Weather, Forecast, and Air Pollution APIs

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **API**: OpenWeatherMap API (Current Weather, 5-Day Forecast, Air Pollution)
- **Design**: CSS Grid, Flexbox, CSS Animations
- **Geolocation**: Browser Geolocation API
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel

## 🎨 Design Highlights

- **Color Scheme**: Purple gradient background with clean white cards
- **Typography**: Segoe UI font family for readability
- **Icons**: Weather-specific icons from OpenWeatherMap
- **Animations**: Smooth hover effects and transitions
- **Accessibility**: Clear labels and semantic HTML

## 📊 API Integration

### OpenWeatherMap APIs Used:
1. **Current Weather Data API**: Real-time weather conditions
2. **5-Day/3-Hour Forecast API**: Extended weather predictions
3. **Air Pollution API**: Air quality index and pollutant data

### Data Points Displayed:
- Temperature (Celsius)
- Weather description
- Humidity percentage
- Wind speed (m/s)
- Sunrise/sunset times
- Air Quality Index (1-5 scale)
- 5-day forecast with min/max/avg temperatures

## 🚀 Performance

- **Fast Loading**: Optimized API calls and minimal dependencies
